# Word-Composition-Problem
## Step to Execute code
**Step 1: Prerequisites**

Ensure you have a C++ development environment set up on your system. You'll need a C++ compiler such as g++.

**Step 2: Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository that contains the C++ code to your local machine using Git. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshshori2002/Word-Composition-Problem.git
```
**Step 3: Compile the Program**
Navigate to the directory where the code is located:
```bash
   cd Word-Composition-Problem
```
Compile the C++ program using your C++ compiler. For example, if you have g++ installed:
```bash
   g++ -o Solution_word_Composition.exe Solution_word_Composition.cpp
```
This command compiles the code and creates an executable file named Solution_word_Composition.exe

**Step 4: Execute the Program**
Run the compiled program using the following command:
```bash
   ./Solution_word_Composition.exe
```
The program will prompt you to choose an input file. Enter 1 to process "Input_01.txt" or 2 to process "Input_02.txt."
**Step 5: View Results**

The program will process the selected input file, identify compound words, and display the longest and second-longest compound words found, along with the time taken for processing. If no compound words are found, it will indicate that.

## Overview 
 -  In this problem, we need to find longer words constructed from smaller words present in the file. These are commonly known as compound words, which are formed by concatenating shorter words also found in the same file.
